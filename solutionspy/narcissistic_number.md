# Narcissistic Mumber

## AAR

### What went well

* Added a mini testing library
* Added a library for reusing code
* Cranked out the solution quickly with div/mod algo.

### What went bad

* Didn't have enough time to test a length of digits using math.floor log10 + 1.
* Didn't have enough time to move digits length function to lib
* Don't know how the log10 function works.

### Lessons Learned / Action Items

* [ ] Learn the `log10` function
